#[SDF05] CSS Magic Button challenge.

In this challenge we were given the opportunuty to express our understanding of the concepts within CSS Animations and Transition by styling the provded buttons and making them your own.

1. Getting Started.

The first step would be to access the project via the Github link provided and access the inforamtion needed to make start the creativity process.

2. Understanding the Assignment.

Once you have acees the required information, you have two option:
    a) start the designs from scratch, or
    b) if you have studying block( the sensation of being overloaded after being exposed to the vastness that is CSS and styling) one can easily access the inspiration attached in the _Codepen_ link.
In this instance, eventhough having a strong case of studying block, I chose to meld these option a bit.

3. Becoming on with the _Code_ (Star Wars, get it?)

After examing the inspiration provided (bless you for that) I decided to play around with a few options that caught my eye.

I didn't simply want to cut and paste the concepts as they were and tweak what was needed
